# Chekov

A to-do list app written in pure, vanilla JavaScript.

Chekov allows users to create to-do lists and add, edit, and delete individual tasks on each list. Data is persisted across browser sessions using local storage.

The application is written using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—no outside libraries, frameworks, or languages are used.

### Original Project

This repository is a fork of a final course project at a coding bootcamp, [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/)’ _Code 201_ course. The original project was created by 4 junior developers (with only 3 weeks of programming experience) in four days.

This fork is a re-working of the original project by [Billy Bunn](https://github.com/BillyBunn), started and completed approximately four months later.
