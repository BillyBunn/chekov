                        <p>Andrew is a software developer whose path into tech was a bit unusual. His expertise in Latin got him his first job in a software company, and from there he moved into project management, where he was first drawn to becoming a developer. After hours you'll find him enjoying the outdoors or holed up with one of his old books of Latin literature.</p>
