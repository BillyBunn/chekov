# Group Agreement
## Communication Plan
* Our group will communicate primarily through Slack direct messages. We exchanged phone numbers and will use text/calls as a  backup.
* We will have a “round robin” meeting at least twice daily (9am and 5pm). In these meetings, we will…
	* Check in on each other, share how we’re dealing with the workload and our responsibilities. Share how our evening after class went the day before.
	* Update each other on our progress on our assigned tasks
	* If necessary, make a game plan to tackle the next task or any new issues we’ve encountered. 
	* In these meetings, we will have a “merge party”, where we combine our code and work through any merge conflicts together.
	* We will agree on any tasks that members will work on until our next meeting.
* To ensure everyone’s voices are heard, our group will not go forward with any major design/code decisions without everyone in the group agreeing and saying their piece. 
* To manage psychological safety, our group will come up with small group traditions to encourage good communication and empathy. Our primary source of this will be the beginning of our daily meetings described above.
## Conflict Plan
* As a general rule, we will bring the issue to the group to discuss in our meetings. We will agree to assume the best of each other in these discussions and practice courtesy and kindness in our words, letting each other speak.
* If the conflict involves a decision on our project’s direction, we will bring it to a group vote. 
* If the conflict isn’t resolved through discussion, we will bring it to our instructor and TA’s.
## Work Plan
* Once we know the functions that need to be built, the design we’re aiming for, and the pieces that need to come together, we will divide tasks amongst ourselves. We will try to play to each others strengths and members can volunteer for the tasks they think they can tackle.
* We will keep a list of tasks in a shared spreadsheet that we will update regularly as we make progress on tasks. 
* We will make sure each member has a couple PR of their work each day, so work can be tracked on GitHub.
## Git Process
* Each day, we will create a branch off of the master branch. The branch names will reflect the date. (Tomorrow’s branch will be created at the last meeting of the day)
* We will each create branches off of this daily branch. These branch names will indicate the feature being worked on in that branch.
* The entire team will review all PRs at our “merge parties”. These occur twice daily.
* Each meeting, we will appoint a “merge party captain” who drives while the rest of the group navigates the PR/merge process. They will merge all PR’s on their machine.
## Other Expectations
* Official work time is 9am–6pm. Members can work additional hours as long as they let the group know what they’ll be working on. 
* Members are encouraged to take regular small breaks to stand up and walk around the block.
